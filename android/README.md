## 🎲 The Game

The game follows a specific 14-round sequence where players score based on the dots remaining in their hand.
- **Rounds:** 14 rounds in total (Double-6 down to Double-0, then back up to Double-6).
- **Spinner:** Each round has a specific "spinner" value that dictates the play.
- **Shaker:** The "shaker" role rotates among the 4 players each round.
- **Goal:** The player with the lowest total score at the end of 14 rounds wins.
